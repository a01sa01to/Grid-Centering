## What is this?

This is a example of which you center an element on a page with Grid(CSS).<br>
See also <https://qiita.com/a01sa01to/items/b8130d7a871e6b3aa31e> (Japanese).

## How to inspect

1. Open <https://repos.a01sa01to.com/Grid-Centering/> .

2. On the top of the page, you'll see a slider and a textbox.

3. By sliding the slider, you can change the font size of the characters "Grid Centering Test".

4. You can change the characters by editing the textbox.

5. If the element of gray is centered when you change these above, inspect is success!
